## Explain of this repository
This repository is a copy of several open-source projects, most of which haven't been updated in years. To prevent these projects from being deleted by the original authors, I created a backup here for learning purposes. The reason I didn't directly fork them is that if I forked every project, these forks would occupy most of my repository content. Also in this reason, I didn't start it. So, I apologize here to the authors of these great open source projects. If my GitHub was mostly filled with forked projects, I would feel a bit lost, as it would mean I don't have many of my own projects. So, I chose a somewhat "out of sight, out of mind" approach. 😫
